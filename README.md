Proj: Pokedex ++

Summary:
  This tool is a small python app that requests the pokeAPI for information on a specified pokemon.
  Pokemon can be searched by name or national dex number
  Currently just grabs and displays information. Soon there will be the option to save the wanted info in a new json
  
  If anyone else wants something added, lmk and Ill try, or take the code and do it yourself, either works

Use Case:
    Used to grab and save specified information about a given pokemon
    Relies on pokeAPI
    I made this for getting pokemon data for fast imports to a game I am working on
    However I feel others might get a use from it so it will inevitably be released to the public
Misc:
    This is my first python program lets goooo
    please dont judge the gross code too much please, Im still getting better
